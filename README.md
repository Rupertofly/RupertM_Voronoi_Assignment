# RupertM_Voronoi_Assignment

a project looking at creating a visual piece that reacted to audio. I'm fascinated with Voronoi patterns, particularly in conjunction with Lloyd relaxation produces a fairly regular pattern with interesting randomness as well So I developed a way of adding sites to the diagram and colouring them based on rhythm and pitch. The Lloyd relaxation, when animated gives the pattern an organic fluid appearance. originally put together in processing, the computational bottlenecks convinced me to lean open frameworks and port my piece to C++.
